overhaul world gen!!! make it not gen a preset thing and safe the world state or so(but without game saving)
make a file where stuff gets calculated what the whole project needs(player pos etc)

General:
	-Sorting as following:
		allocate every scene,script etc into same respecitve folder,
		everything for player goes into player, same with terrain, enemys, building etc

	-Make a rough game loop scetch or so
		satisfactory style with tiers and research?
		or only research?
	-(Maybe add gatcha stuff?)
		probably only as something not for the game experience

Game:
	Fixes:
		-make it so tile map takey 32x32pixel sizes, and every ong sprite is treated as a full 32x32 sprite

	Features:
		-starting gui
		
		-generall game saving
		
		-inventory?
		
		-generall machines, like miners belts to establish general game loop
		
		-trains
		
		-game runs over energy
		
		-when building display a grid to make it easier
		
		(big maybe and when only at the end)
			-different nations and option to wage war
			-builtunits(only vehicles, infantry will be like 86 drones)
			-manage resources for units(oil,steel etc)
			-make peace
			-make ai smart and dont senslessly rage war(make them want resources and power)
		
	World generation:
		-give every tile more info or so when i check if i can place a building it just gets info and so
		
		-consider changing angle a bit(not pure topdown)
		
		-consider being able to build over several layers upward(tied to trains)
		
		-make biomes and map larger
		
		-Precdual generation
			make own art for grounds and define better numbers for cleaner lock
			make assets generate in clumps, so a bush generates not just one tile of the tile set
				when generating assets make sure they are placed correctly
				and not placed on ore nodes etc

		-let the generation generate ore tiles etc
	
	Graphical stuff:
		-Make own art or tiles sets in generall
		
		-make art for more machines,player etc

	Perforance:
		-try making a general class/file/script where some global always needed variables are being put into the main calcs to have every time?
		
		-Make better rendering
			so the tiles only get drawn generate when the player is in the area or camere shows them
			
		-introduce chunks
			figure out how i can divide my game into chunks
			
		-Figure out how to handle machines etc
		
		-Make game go over ticks?
