General:
	-Figure out how i want to sort my stuff:
		All szenes,scripts assets etc in sep folders.
		Or bundel all what goes together in a folder.

	-Make a rough game loop scetch or so
		satisfactory style with tiers and research?
		or only research?
	-(Maybe add gatcha stuff?)
		probably only as something not for the game experience

Game:
	Fixes:
		-Fix building UI/holograms
			very big mouse offset currently and doesnt reall snaps to grid how i want it to
			maybe bundel assets and scripts together?

	Features:
		-make hotkey to acces build menu directly
		
		-game runs over energy
		
	World generation:
		-Fix gameloop so generation happens only once
		
		-Precdual generation
			make own art for grounds and define better numbers for cleaner lock
			make assets generate in clumps, so a bush generates not just one tile of the tile set
				when generating assets make sure they are placed correctly
				and not placed on ore nodes etc

		-let the generation generate ore tiles etc
	
	Graphical stuff:
		-Make own art or tiles sets in generall
		
		-make art for more machines,player etc

	Perforance:
		-Make better rendering
			so the tiles only get drawn generate when the player is in the area or camere shows them
			
		-introduce chunks
			figure out how i can divide my game into chunks
			
		-Figure out how to handle machines etc
		
		-Make game go over ticks?
