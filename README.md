# 🏭 Project Name (Working Title)

A 2D factory automation game built with the Godot Engine using GDScript.

This is a personal hobby project focused on learning game architecture, procedural generation, optimization techniques, and automation system design.

---

## 🎮 About The Game

This project is inspired by the gameplay depth of Factorio and the satisfying production flow of Satisfactory, while aiming to introduce original mechanics and systems.

The goal is to create a factory-building experience that is:

- System-driven
- Performance-conscious
- Modular and scalable
- Visually clean and readable

This is **not a commercial project** — it exists purely for learning, experimentation, and fun.

## 🔁 Core Gameplay Loop (Planned)

1. Explore a procedurally generated world  
2. Extract raw resources  
3. Process materials using machines  
4. Automate production chains  
5. Optimize logistics and expand the factory  

The focus is on building increasingly complex and efficient systems.
