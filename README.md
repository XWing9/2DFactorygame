A 2D factory game written in GDScipt using the Goddot Engine.
Maybe C++ will be used to write some systems when Performance get to low.

Its inspired by the mechanics and Gameplay of Factorio and Satisfactory.

This project is a solely hobby Projekt, i dont plan on selling it.
Its just for me to learn and have the fun of programming my own game.

Features that are under Development/Planned:
  Further Optimization and improvement on Procedual Generation - under active Development
  The real gameplay loop to be able to use Machines - under Development
  Showing a grid when placing machines - Planned
